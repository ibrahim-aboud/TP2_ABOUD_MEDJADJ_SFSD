inorder to directly execute the app, follow the path : MEDJADJ_ABOUD_TP2_G2/bin/Debug/MEDJADJ_ABOUD_TP2_G2.exe

before using our app, we recommend updating the font : "CONSOLAS" (already existing on your computer), by 

right-clicking every ".ttf" file in the folder CONSOLAS-POLICE and choosing "install" 

updating "reinstalling" the font is recommended for a smooth experience and an appealing user interface

if the interface still looks off (text not centered ... etc) then try the following

- execute the app, right click on the top bar of the black command line and select setttings, then set

the number of rows and columns to 40 rows and 160 columns " the app is supposed to automatically set

these values, but it is ok to confirm"

- if after that the window looks too big, go to settings -> display settings -> and change the scale

 to a lower percentage, for example if you have the scale set to 150%, change it to 125% or 100%

"you can go back to the original scale if the icons look too small "

if you have any problems contact us !
